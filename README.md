# access
Personal notes to help me remember wcag advice.

Both the notes and the checker are still mid-development, and developed quickly, so don't rely on these tools for full accessibility testing.

Open the notes:  https://r12a.github.io/access/

Open the checker: https://r12a.github.io/access/checker/

Note that the checker will only check a file in the same domain, so far, so you'll probably need to run it on local files on your desktop.
